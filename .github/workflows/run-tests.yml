  # First, work out whether the user that triggered the run is a collaborator or not.
  # WARNING: without this check, we should NOT use pull_request_target as a trigger above,
  # and revert to pull_request, as pull_request_target is insecure without an explicit
  # permissions check.
  # If the user is a collaborator, we go ahead and run the PR.  If the user is not, then we runs-on
  # against the test-external environment, which blocks, waiting for manual approval from GWF staff
  # before doing anything further.
  # We also identify the `ref` of the code to test: as pull_request_target
  # is run on the *target* branch of the PR, we need to explicitly check this out, once we've
  # verified the user permissions, and manually reviewed the code.
