Welcome to Green Web Foundation Platform documentation!
=============================================================

Welcome to the documentation for the Green Web platform. This site project contains documentation for the code for serving:

- the admin interface used by hosting provider, at `admin.thegreenwebfoundation.org`
- the API that serves requests at `api.thegreenwebfoundation.org`

This site also provides a summary of the other main libraries maintained by the Green Web Foundation, namely [`co2js`][co2js], a javascript library for understanding and managing the carbon emissions from software, and the green web [`grid-intensity` libraries][grid-intensity-libraries], designed to help design carbon aware digital services that respond to the carbon intensity conditions on the electricity grids the internet relies on.

[grid-intensity-libraries]: https://github.com/thegreenwebfoundation?q=grid-intensity&type=all&language=&sort=
