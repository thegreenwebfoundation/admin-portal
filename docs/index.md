Welcome to Green Web Foundation Platform documentation!
=============================================================

Welcome to the documentation for the Green Web platform. This site project contains documentation for the code for serving:

- the admin interface used by hosting provider, at admin.thegreenwebfoundation.org
- the API that serves requests at api.thegreenwebfoundation.org

This site also provides a sumamry of the other main libraries maintained by the Green Web Foundation, namely `co2js`, a javascript library for understanding and managing the carbon emissions from software, and the green web `grid-intensity` libraries, designed to help design carbon aware digital services that respond to the carbon intensity conditions on the electricity grids the internet relies on.
