# Working with the Green Web Open Data

Every day the Green Web Foundation publishes a daily snapshot dataset of green domains, and who hosts them. We call this the `green domains` dataset, and it is available at [datasets.thegreenwebfoundation.org](https://datasets.thegreenwebfoundation.org). For more, see the [dedicated dataset documentation](https://datasets.thegreenwebfoundation.org/about) on that site.
