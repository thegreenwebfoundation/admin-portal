        Override a whacky ModelFormSets behavior in order to
        render initial forms correctly (important for the preview step!)

        Problem #1: ModelFormSets take "initial" argument to populate initial forms,
        but the value is truncated to the number of "extra" forms
        as configured in the modelformset_factory. Example:

        MyModelFormset.extra = 1
        formset = MyModelFormset(initial=[data1, data2, data3])
        formset.forms == 1 # and with this fix it's 3 as we'd expect

        Problem #2: FormSets that have min_num argument passed greater than 0
        (requiring at least 1 form to be submitted) have some internal magic that
        manipulate the number of extra forms based on that. For those the value
        needs to be decreased to acommodate for that. Otherwise the preview step
        displays empty extra forms. Example:

        MyModelFormset.extra = 1
        MyModelFormset.min_num = 1
        formset = MyModelFormset(initial=[data1])
        formset.forms == 2 # and with this fix it's 1 as we'd expect
