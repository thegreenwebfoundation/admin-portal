  {% elif active_step == 3 %}

    The website at your primary domain should now show the correct provider in the Green Web Check.</p>
    <p>Finally, we'll configure your customer domains to point to the carbon.txt you just created, so that they are also correctly attributed to you.</p>
  {% else %}
