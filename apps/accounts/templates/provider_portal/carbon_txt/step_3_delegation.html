<h3>Configure carbon.txt sharing</h3>
<p>
Your secondary domains are the domains of your customers, or any other domain which you want to be attributed to you in the Green Web platform.
</p><p>
For providers who resell other services, we recommend doing this by setting up a custom <strong>HTTP response header</strong> on all the domains you host, advertising the carbon.txt hosted on your primary domain. Configure your web server or proxy to add the <strong>CarbonTxt-Location</strong> header listed below (see <a href="https://carbontxt.org/quickstart" target="_blank">the carbon.txt documentation</a> for further details</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/thegreenwebfoundation/carbon.txt/tree/master/examples" target="_blank">instructions for some popular web servers</a> such as Apache, Nginx and Caddy).
</p>
<div class="copyable p-2 bg-neutral-200 flex justify-between">
  <code class="content">CarbonTxt-Location: {{provider.carbon_txt.domain}}</code>
  <a href="#" class="copy no-underline">ðŸ“‹</a>
</div>
<p>
If you are unable to set an HTTP header, you can also advertise the carbon.txt location by setting a DNS TXT record, <a href="https://carbontxt.org/faq#upload" target="_blank">see the documentation for further details</a>.
