Dear hoster,

{% if user.date_joined %}On {{ user.date_joined }}{% else %}Some time in the past{% endif %} you registered {{ host.name }} at the Green Web Directory [1]. A recent check discovered that your website ({{ host.website }}) no longer turns up as green when checked against the green credentials available in our system for your company.

For now, we have placed {{ host.name }} on the list of green hosters that need to update their ASN or ip-ranges in the admin system [2]. After approval, the website will be visible in the Green Web Directory again.

Thanks for your help in keeping the Green Web Directory up-to-date! We’re experiencing significant growth in the number of checks against the database, currently over 7 million per day and counting, so it does make sense!

With best regards,
Green Web Foundation Support Team
